* Tokenizer

** add comment support

** add doctype support

** factor saxg code

   most sub generators are the same

** monadic parser ?

* XML parser

** Stream of inst | otag | etag | text -> Tree

   stack shift reduce

   inst -> push (Inst.)
   otag -> push (Tag. ...)
   text -> top.append it
   etag -> t = pop; top.append it

** DONE Bug: cycle in tree construction
   see commit e655648

** DONE Bug: non supported xml objects impedes reduction

   <!-- .... --> is seen as a tag, thus absorbs subsequent nodes,
   confusing the recursive logic.

   Better hypothesis: self-closing tags appending linearly since no
   etag to reduce.

   Solution: tokenizer could issue both ('otag', ...) then ('etag', ...)
   on the fly. *Tokenizing sugar*...

   Bug fixed (80% confidence)
